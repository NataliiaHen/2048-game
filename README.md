# Miami Landing Page

## Project Description:
### Brief Overview:
2048 is a classic single-player sliding puzzle game where the player combines tiles to reach the 2048 tile. The game starts with two tiles, each with a value of 2 or 4. The player can slide the tiles in four directions - up, down, left, or right, and all tiles on the board move in that direction. When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into one, doubling the value. The goal is to reach the 2048 tile and achieve the highest score possible.

### Technologies Used:
HTML: Employed for structuring the content of the landing page.
CSS: Used for styling and layout, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing design.
SCSS: Utilized for enhanced stylesheet authoring, providing features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
JavaScript: The game logic and interactivity are implemented using JavaScript.
GitHub Pages: Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access and sharing.
